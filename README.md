got bored and did a crappy chatgpt written gui
also, cheater detection isnt working, nocrex pls fix
how to use:
1. find your tf2 path and choose where you want the dump to be created by choosing "output file" on the parser tab
2. press start processing, this will lag a lot and may take a long time if you have a lot of demos
3. go to demo browser tab
4. search for the name or if you have a steamid64 put "steamid:" (without the quotes) in front of it and then press search
